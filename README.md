# Heart-Disease-Prediction
Early Prediction of Heart Disease using Machine Learning Algorithms.

Preventing Heart diseases has become more than necessary. Good data-driven systems for predicting heart diseases can improve the entire research and prevention process, making sure that more people can live healthy lives. This is where Machine Learning comes into play. Machine Learning helps in predicting the Heart diseases, and the predictions made are quite accurate.

The project involved analysis of the heart disease patient dataset with proper data processing and visualization techniques to get good understanding of the features and how they are impacting heart disease score. Then, a model was trained and predictions were made with Random Forest algorithm. This is a jupyter notebook code and dataset I've used.

I've used this Machine Learning algorithm, implemented in Python, to predict the presence of heart disease in a patient. This is a classification problem, with input features as a variety of parameters, and the target variable as a binary variable, predicting whether heart disease is present or not.
